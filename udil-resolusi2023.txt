UDIL RESOLUSI
I will consistently study programming for 6 hours a day and gradually increase my study time.
First, I will start with web development.
Secondly, because I enjoy playing games, I will try my hand at game development to explore new challenges and improve my programming skills even further. 
Moreover, I would also like to explore mobile app development and build my own applications.
Additionally, diving into data science and machine learning seems intriguing, as it offers opportunities to work on exciting projects and solve real-world problems using AI algorithms. 
Finally, I aim to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers to gain exposure to diverse perspectives and enhance my coding abilities.
"My aspiration is to create a game that can generate revenue, similar to other successful games in the industry."
